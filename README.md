The following program is implemented to multiply two fixed-point numbers.
The numbers are unsigned.
Each number has 32 bits (single precision).
The number has no integral bits.
MSB = 2^(-1) and LSB = 2^(-32).
Call the program using the following format and get the result from the terminal window,
./FirstPointMul 0xFirstNumberInHEX 0xSecondNumberInHEX
